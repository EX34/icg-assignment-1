assignment 1 for icg due 26/05/2021

Description:
What we have is a website with a customer and staff side. On the customer side it is going to be a website where users can create accounts or log in and then using special code on the product they will certify that they have bought this item. After which they will review it and then when they submit the review they will get reward points that they can use to get discounts or free items from the company's range of products a the selected distributors. They can also browse the website like a catalog to read more information about the items. There will also be a special section where people who are logged in can do a survey about the products for some points. All the info from the customers goes into the customer relations database
On the staff side there will be an option to login as an employee or as an admin(only the boss and it people). Here the employees have a tool to scheduleÂ  other employees. In the scheduler they can set events like for example a meeting or team building event. Employees can also set deadline reminders in the scheduler . People who have access to admin accounts are able to set deadline for other employees they are also able to add or remove employees /their information. They can also add or remove products from the customer side of the site and mark somethibg in or out of stock.
Note this *not* an online selling website they continue to sell through their distributors
